## TODO

- Consider implementing a robust domain parsing solution:
  - Evaluate the PHP Domain Parser library for accurate TLD and ccTLD handling.
  - Update the `DomainRepository::create()` method to use the chosen parsing library.
  - Note: This will add a new dependency to the project.
  - Example implementation:

    ```php
    use Pdp\Rules;
    use Pdp\Domain;

    class DomainRepository
    {
        // ... existing code ...

        public function create(array $data): Domain
        {
            $fullDomain = $data['name'];
            
            $rules = Rules::fromPath('/path/to/public_suffix_list.dat');
            $domain = Domain::fromIDNA2008($fullDomain);
            $result = $rules->resolve($domain);

            $data['name'] = $result->registrableDomain()->toString();
            $data['extension'] = $result->suffix()->toString();

            return Domain::create($data);
        }

        // ... existing code ...
    }
    ```
